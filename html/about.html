<h2>Rabbit Diet</h2>

<body> A rabbit will eat manty veggies. Most modern day humans believe that rabbits prefer carrots, but in reality, carrots are too sweet for the rabbits. They prefer them as a sweet treat, not something to be eaten very often. Certain kinds of lettuce, leafy greens, and other veggies are great food for rabbits. * Remember, rabbits can't throw up their food, so if they choke, they can die. To prevent this, you can make the veggies into small to medium sized piecesfor easy eating.* </body>

<h2> Caring For A Rabbit </h2>

<body> Wehn caring for your rabbit, make sure that they are happy and well cared for. You do not want to isolate them, because they will start feeling depressed and lonely. Their cage should be big enough for the rabbit to hop four times from one end to the other. Chewable toys are recommended so they can chew on it. A "hidey hole" is also recommended for the rabbit so if they feel scared or threatened, they can go into it. Try and let them out of their cage a few hours everyday. If you want to train it to do certain things be patient. Always reward good behavior, and ignore bad behavior.</body>
