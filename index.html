        <h2>What Really Happens</h2>
        <p> Imagine that you are a rabbit. You're in a lab, and you have no idea of what is happening. You don't know how you got here, and you especially do not know what is going to happen to you. You're scared and frightened now, especially since you see a man and a woman in white walking up to you. You freeze and stay still, petrified and worried, hoping that they will take you to safety, to home. Instead, they take you somewhere else. It is a white, clean table, and they make you lie down. You think you know what is going to happen to you, but you don't know for sure. Hopefully, those people are doctors, giving you medicine to keep you healthy, but if not, then you know that your time has come. You're going to be tested on, with many products being put on you. Nothing can compare to what is going to happen to you now.  </p>
        <p> They lay you down on the table, blindfold you, strap you onto the table, and smear something on you pelt. It stings, and you want to scream. You panic, and thrash around, trying to get free. But you can't. They won't allow it. The people keep puting things on you, and each one hurts more and more. You want to die, and as soon as you are about to give up, they inject something into you. It ends the pain, but also ends more. You think," Why did I have to end up like this? How did I deserve it? At least the worst is over... I hope..."  </p>
        <h2>What Can We Do About It?</h2>
        <p> As you can see, the animal being tested on is not exactly enjoying it. That is animal testing, and it is when companies try and test their product on animals, to see if they are fit for humans. The thing is, when the animals are being tested on, it is against their own will. Cosmetic companies, shampoo companies, toothpaste companies, and many more corperations do this. It started to go public, and people have started putting up new laws to ban this animal testing. As a human, you can try and help keep people aware of this kind of behavior and treatment on animals. Teach and keep people aware of it. You can also help by buying products that have a symbol on it, mostly of a bunny/rabbit, which means that the product was not tested on animals.  </p>
